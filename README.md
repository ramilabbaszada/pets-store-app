The app was primarily developed using .Net web api and React , serving as an  platform to explore various concepts and techniques 
in modern front-end and back-end development. 

Info:This app is designed to request pet information from a public API and show relevant content to users. The User Identification
service is implemented on the backend side. Users can view details of pets from different locations and apply for adopting them. 
Additionally, logging, caching, validation, and transaction services are implemented using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP). 
JWT and Refresh Token are used for user identification. All CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations have been implemented for all entities.
